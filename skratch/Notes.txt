Skratcher
  - Most of Skratcher is the keyDown event
    - Mostly talks to the SourceFile

SourceView
  - getFormattedText is the largest method
  - Really all it does is generate text from the SourceFile and fill it into
  the viewPanel

SourceFile
  - Tracks file contents
  - Controls cursor
  - Manages insertion + deletion of text


TODO: Notes on files
  - global.js
  - keyboard-values.js
  - extension-functions.js
  - debug.js
  - settings.js
  - main.js

Tasks:
  - Implement file saving w/ database
    - Try to abstract implementation so it is trivial to switch the data store from
    localStorage to something like Relativity or mongoDB

  - Implement a parser
    - Does the file need an abstracted representation?
      - Is this going to be just a code editor, or a WYSIWYG?

  - Iron out which classes should be responsible for what

  - Clean up keyboard stuff (there shouldn't be so much of this inside skratcher.js)



- Look into Prototypes tutorial
  - Also, design patterns

- Using self/me = {} in private methods?

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
y = '0123456789';
