# nPyREPL

A server and library to host terminal programs (namely REPLs) that can be accessed via TCP/WebSockets/HTTP written in Python.

The eventual goal with this is to create a plugin for Sublime Text that support Autocomplete, REPL integration, and a debugger/variable watcher for Clojure as well as a single page web application with the same functionality.
