# My Experimental Projects

This is a collection of toy projects I am working on and did not wish to have a dedicated repository for.

- nPyREPL: A way to access a remote Python REPL via WebSockets
- PushMidi: An example of how to communicate with an Ableton Push via Midi in Python
- ffox-widget: Currently the source to a music player extension for firefox with mp3 support. Will be creating a tab/session saver
- skratch: A simple vim-like JavaScript text editor
